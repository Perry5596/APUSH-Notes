_"The people, even the lowest ranks, have become more attentive to their liberties, more inquisitive about them, and more determined to defend them than they were ever before known and had occasion to be."_ - **John Addams, 1765**

## Imperial Wars & Colonial Protest - 1754-1774

### Why did American colonists become more "attentive" to their liberties?

1. Britain became involved in several imperial wars in the late 17th century.
1. Wars cost money and this led to debts for the crown.
1. Britain began aggressively collecting taxes from the colonists.

## The Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) - 1754-1763

Global conflict between Britain and France.

- Long-lasting conflict between Great Britain and France that were primarily fought in Europe.
- In an effor to limit British growth westward, the French built a series of forts on the Ohio River Valley
- The British suffered losses at first but ultimately were victorious and established the dominance in North America over the other European powers
- When the war was over, the way the colonists and the British viewed each other changed drastically

> The British viewed the French Indian war as a protection of the colonists. It cost them a lot of money and the colonists now need to pay up. The colonists viewed it as they just helped Britain out by kicking out the French, and they expect Britain to pay them in the land they just conqured.

## Albany Plan of Union

During the French and Indian War, the British realized that they needed the colonists to coordinate for defense. Representatives from seven colonies met in Albany, New York in 1754. The resolution, developed by Benjamin Franklin, called for each colony to contribute tax money for defense. However, the plan never went into effect but it set a precedent for more revolutionary congresses in the 1770s.

## Shift In British Colonial Policies

- Proclamation of 1763:
  1. In order to prevent further attacks from the American Indians on the western fronteir, the British government issued a proclamation prohibiting colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains
  1. This infuriated colonists who felt as though they had earned access to the western territory from their contribution to the French and Indian War.
  1. Thousands defied the proclamation and moved westward anyway.

## Shift in British COlonial Policies

- Sugar Act 1764
  1. Placed taxes on sugar and other luxuries to gain revenue for the crown
- Quartering Act 1765
  1. Required colonists to provide food and living quarters for British soldiers stationed in the colonies
- Stamp act 1765
  1. Required stamps to be purchased on paper goods in the colonies: legal documents, newspapers, pamphlets, and advertisments
  1. This was the first direct tax on the people, not just on merchants

## The Sons and Daughters of Liberty

The Sons of Liberty and the Daughters of Liberty were secret societies formed originally in protest of the Stamp Act. The Sons often intimidated tax agents, destroyed revenue stamps and tarred and feathered tax officials. The Daughters sewed clothes at home rather than buy British textiles. They organized a colonial boycott of all British goods and due to the sharp decline in trade, parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766. Notable members include: Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Patrick Henry.

## The Townshend Acts

1. Named for the new `chancellor of the exchequer` (Official of the Treasury), Charles Townshend
1. Enacted new taxes on imports like tea, glass, and paper
1. Allowed for the search of private homes for smuggled goods
1. Colonists again boycotted British goods
1. 1770: under a new prime minister, the Townshend Acts were repealed.

## The Boston Massacre

March 1770: British troops, stationed in the colonies to protect customs officials from the Sons of Liberty, fired into a crowd of colonists, killing 5 people, including `Crispus Attucks`. The British soldiers were put on trial for murder and their defense attorney was John Adams. Under Adams' defence, the soldiers were acquitted. Howeverm the incident was seen by the colonists as a massacre and inflamed anti-British opinion.

## The Boston Tea Party

The colonists were still boycotting British Tea because they refused to pay the tax on it. Instead, they smuggled Dutch tea into the colonies. In 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act which made British tea cheaper than the smuggled Dutch tea. When a ship carrying British tea arrived at Boston Harbor, a group of colonists disguised as American Indians, dumped 342 chests of the tea into the harbor. Some colonists supported this act of defiance while others felt that it was too radical.

## Intolerable Acts (1774)

Angered by the Boston Tea Party, Parliament retaliated by passing a series of legislation that the colonists referred to as the Intolerable acts

1. `Port Act` -Closed the port of boston until the destroyed tea was paid for.
1. `Massachusetts Government Act` -Reduced the power of the assembly and increased the power of the royal governor.
1. `Administration of Justice Act` -Allowed for British officials accused of crimes to be tried for them in England, not the colonies.
1. `Expansion of the Quartering Act` -Troops would be quartered in private homes in all colonies.
