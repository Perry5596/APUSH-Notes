# Creating a Nation - Foner Notes - Chapters 5-8 - Pages 183-325 - Years: 1744-1800

_"The people, even the lowest ranks, have become more attentive to their liberties, more inquisitive about them, and more determined to defend them than they were ever before known and had occasion to be."_ - **John Addams, 1765**

## Imperial Wars & Colonial Protest - 1754-1774

### Why did American colonists become more "attentive" to their liberties?

1. Britain became involved in several imperial wars in the late 17th century.
1. Wars cost money and this led to debts for the crown.
1. Britain began aggressively collecting taxes from the colonists.

## The Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) - 1754-1763

Global conflict between Britain and France.

- Long-lasting conflict between Great Britain and France that were primarily fought in Europe.
- In an effor to limit British growth westward, the French built a series of forts on the Ohio River Valley
- The British suffered losses at first but ultimately were victorious and established the dominance in North America over the other European powers
- When the war was over, the way the colonists and the British viewed each other changed drastically

> The British viewed the French Indian war as a protection of the colonists. It cost them a lot of money and the colonists now need to pay up. The colonists viewed it as they just helped Britain out by kicking out the French, and they expect Britain to pay them in the land they just conqured.

## Albany Plan of Union

During the French and Indian War, the British realized that they needed the colonists to coordinate for defense. Representatives from seven colonies met in Albany, New York in 1754. The resolution, developed by Benjamin Franklin, called for each colony to contribute tax money for defense. However, the plan never went into effect but it set a precedent for more revolutionary congresses in the 1770s.

## Shift In British Colonial Policies

- Proclamation of 1763:
  1. In order to prevent further attacks from the American Indians on the western fronteir, the British government issued a proclamation prohibiting colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains
  1. This infuriated colonists who felt as though they had earned access to the western territory from their contribution to the French and Indian War.
  1. Thousands defied the proclamation and moved westward anyway.

## Shift in British COlonial Policies

- Sugar Act 1764
  1. Placed taxes on sugar and other luxuries to gain revenue for the crown
- Quartering Act 1765
  1. Required colonists to provide food and living quarters for British soldiers stationed in the colonies
- Stamp act 1765
  1. Required stamps to be purchased on paper goods in the colonies: legal documents, newspapers, pamphlets, and advertisments
  1. This was the first direct tax on the people, not just on merchants

## The Sons and Daughters of Liberty

The Sons of Liberty and the Daughters of Liberty were secret societies formed originally in protest of the Stamp Act. The Sons often intimidated tax agents, destroyed revenue stamps and tarred and feathered tax officials. The Daughters sewed clothes at home rather than buy British textiles. They organized a colonial boycott of all British goods and due to the sharp decline in trade, parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766. Notable members include: Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Patrick Henry.

## The Townshend Acts

1. Named for the new `chancellor of the exchequer` (Official of the Treasury), Charles Townshend
1. Enacted new taxes on imports like tea, glass, and paper
1. Allowed for the search of private homes for smuggled goods
1. Colonists again boycotted British goods
1. 1770: under a new prime minister, the Townshend Acts were repealed.

## The Boston Massacre

March 1770: British troops, stationed in the colonies to protect customs officials from the Sons of Liberty, fired into a crowd of colonists, killing 5 people, including `Crispus Attucks`. The British soldiers were put on trial for murder and their defense attorney was John Adams. Under Adams' defence, the soldiers were acquitted. Howeverm the incident was seen by the colonists as a massacre and inflamed anti-British opinion.

## The Boston Tea Party

The colonists were still boycotting British Tea because they refused to pay the tax on it. Instead, they smuggled Dutch tea into the colonies. In 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act which made British tea cheaper than the smuggled Dutch tea. When a ship carrying British tea arrived at Boston Harbor, a group of colonists disguised as American Indians, dumped 342 chests of the tea into the harbor. Some colonists supported this act of defiance while others felt that it was too radical.

## Intolerable Acts (1774)

Angered by the Boston Tea Party, Parliament retaliated by passing a series of legislation that the colonists referred to as the Intolerable acts

1. `Port Act` -Closed the port of boston until the destroyed tea was paid for.
1. `Massachusetts Government Act` -Reduced the power of the assembly and increased the power of the royal governor.
1. `Administration of Justice Act` -Allowed for British officials accused of crimes to be tried for them in England, not the colonies.
1. `Expansion of the Quartering Act` -Troops would be quartered in private homes in all colonies.

# The American Revolution and Confederation - 1774-1787

## The Revolutionary War Within

### Patriots

1. Largest number came from New England and Virginia
1. Usually formed local militias and only served for short periods of time before they had to return to their farms
1. Chronically short of supplies and equipment and rarely paid
1. Although initially denied, African Americans were offered freedom in return for service. Approximately 5000 African Americans served in the Patriot Army

### Loyalists

1. Also called Tories after the majority party in Parliament
1. Nearly 60,000 Tories fought alongside the British army during the Revolution
1. Majority of loyalists were from New York, New Jersey, and Georgia
1. Loyalists tended to be wealthier and more conservative than the Patriots
1. Often members of the same family joined opposite sides; Ben Franklin’s son was a loyalist

## The First Continental Congress

- September 1774: delegates from every colony, except Georgia, met at a convention in Philadelphia to discuss how to address the Intolerable Acts; their intention was not yet independence. The outcome:
  1.  Suffolk Resolves: called for the immediate repeal of the Intolerable Acts and for the colonies to boycott all British goods and to begin making military preparations
  1.  Declaration and Resolves: a petition that asked the king to restore colonial rights
  1.  Continental Association: created an organization to enforce the boycotts called for by the Suffolk Resolves
  1.  Lastly, they decided that if the issues were not resolved, they would meet again in May of 1775

## Fighting Begins...

- The king angrily dismissed the petitions of the First Continental Congress and sent more troops to Massachusetts to put down any further rebellion

- Lexington and Concord: April 18, 1775:
  1.  The British troops marched towards Concord to seize colonial military supplies
  1.  After being warned by Paul Revere during his famous midnight ride, the colonial militia (or Minutemen) assembled to resist in Lexington
  1.  Under heavy British fire, the colonists were forced to retreat
  1.  The British continued their march into Concord where they destroyed colonial military supplies
  1.  On their march back to Boston, the British were attacked by hundreds of Minutemen and suffered 250 casualties

### Minutemen

Although sometimes used interchangeably, there was a notable difference between the colonial militia and Minutemen. The militias were men who took up arms to defend their towns. Whereas, the Minutemen were a more elite group of men who were typically the best troops of their militia. It was not uncommon for colonial militia to include older men but the Minutemen were young, enthusiastic, and physically fit. The Minutemen were called this because it was believed that they could be ready for battle at a minute’s notice.

## The Second Continental Congress

- Shortly after Lexington and Concord, the Congress met again in Philadelphia in May 1775. The delegates were torn. New England colonies were eager for independence but the Middle Colonies wanted to restore the relationship with the crown. The outcome:
  1.  The delegates called on colonies to provide troops for the continental army and appointed George Washington the commander-in-chief
  1.  Olive Branch Petition: the Congress’s last attempt at peace when they sent a document to King George III asking him to protect colonial rights; King George dismissed the document and declared the colonies in rebellion

## Common Sense, Thomas Paine, 1776

In January 1776, a pamphlet was published by Thomas Paine. In the pamphlet, Paine argued that colonial independence from Great Britain was essential. Paine asserted that remaining under British control was contrary to common sense because it was illogical for a nation of that size to be ruled by a distant, much smaller, mother country. The pamphlet was widely circulated through the colonies and contributed to the changing public opinion of independence.

## The Declaration of Independence

- After meeting for over a year in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress started to shift to favor independence rather than reconciliation.
- Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a resolution calling for independence
  1.  the congress adopted the resolution on July 2
  1.  Thomas Jefferson drafted a document outlining the grievances of against King George III
  1.  The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776

## The Early Revolutionary War

- Initially, the revolutionary army suffered numerous losses; they were poorly equipped and poorly trained

- By 1777, the British had occupied New York and Philadelphia

- TURNING POINT: Victory at Saratoga
  1.  the Patriot army attacked the British at Saratoga and forced them to surrender
  1.  When news of the American victory reached France, King Louis XVI decided to openly ally with the patriots
  1.  This diplomatic outcome was far more beneficial than the military victory

## Victory For The Patriots

- Yorktown 1781: the last major battle of the war fought in Yorktown, Virginia; with the help of the French, Washington’s army forced a surrender from British General Charles Cornwallis

- The war had become unpopular in Great Britain because of the damage to the economy and a change in political party led to a full surrender

- Treaty of Paris 1783:
  1.  Britain would recognize the United States as an independent nation
  1.  The Mississippi River would be the US western boundary
  1.  Americans would have fishing rights off of the Canadian coast
  1.  Americans would pay debts owed to British merchants

## We Won! Now What?

- The states, having just successfully rebelled against a strong centralized government, each wanted the autonomy to govern themselves

- By 1777, ten of the former colonies had written their own state constitutions

- THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION:

  1.  The first written document that created a very weak central government

  1.  consisted of just one unicameral legislature

  1.  each state was given one vote with 9/13 required to pass laws

## The Problems with the Articles - 1781-1787

- Financial

The Articles did not grant a power to tax; there was no national income and there was no national currency. War debts were unpaid.

- Foreign

European nations had little respect for a new nation that could neither pay debts or unite under one government. States had their own militia but there was no national army.

- Domestic

The Articles did not grant power to regulate trade; states were in competition with each other. There was no way to enforce laws or settle disputes between states.

- A modified version of the plan with lower tariffs was eventually passed by congress.

### Foreign Policy

#### The French Revolution:
