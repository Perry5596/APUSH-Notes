  1. Daniel Webster, Massachusetts, argued that the compromise would save the Union

### Tensions Resurface

After the passage of the Compromise of 1850, there was a brief four year period of relaxed political tension. However, resistance to the Fugitive Slave Law and the publication of antislavery literature reignited the conflict.

- Fugitive Slave Law:
  1. Agreed upon in the compromise of 1850

## Dred Scott vs. Sandford 1857

### The Case

Scott had been held in slavery in Missouri and then taken to the free territory of Wisconsin. When he moved back to Missouri, he argued that he his residence on free soil now made him a free citizen. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

### The Ruling

The presiding Chielf Justice was a southern democrat, Roger Taney. The court decided against Scott and gave the following justification:

1. Dred Scott had no right to sue in federal court as they didn't believe him to be a citizen
1. Congress did not have the power to deprive any person of property
1. The Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because Congress did not have the power to exclude slavery from the territories of Wisconsin and other Northern territories

### The Impact

The ruling was favorable among Southern Democrats but infuriated Northern Republicans. The Supreme Court had essentially ruled that all of the western territories were open to slavery. However, the lasting impact was detrimental to the Democratic party. Many former Democrats shifted their support to the Republican party because they thought the decisiion was a corrupt conspiracy to expand slavery.

Within the next six weeks, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, also secede
